                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. 
                <br>
                <br> He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>

            <div class="bacon-column-1-2">
                <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride."
                    <br>
                    <br>There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                        <br><br>She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of tea. </p>
